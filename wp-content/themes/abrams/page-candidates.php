			<p class="pb-10 nobottommargin">The best candidates for refractive surgery are those who:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><i class="icon-checkmark"></i> Are 18 years of age or older</li>
				<li><i class="icon-checkmark"></i> Have a stable prescription for at least 12 months</li>
				<li><i class="icon-checkmark"></i> Have a disease free cornea and otherwise healthy eye</li>
				<li><i class="icon-checkmark"></i> Have a small to high amount of nearsightedness or astigmatism or a small amount of farsightedness</li>
				<li><i class="icon-checkmark"></i> Are not currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant within the next six months or nursing for at least the past two months</li>
			</ul>
			<p>NOTE: The success of refractive surgery will vary depending on the amount of nearsightedness, farsightedness, general health of the eye and the age of the patient. There is no upper age limit. However, as part of the natural aging process, the eye tends to become presbyopic (lose the ability to focus up close). Therefore, reading glasses will become necessary sometime after the age of 40.</p>
			<p class="nobottommargin pb-10 surgery-title">Which surgery is right for me?</p><p class="notopmargin">The actual LASIK procedure process is performed the same way in both conventional LASIK and Custom LVC. Conventional LASIK is still an excellent choice for many patients. Your doctor will recommend which procedure is best for you based on your consultation results; he will help you determine if you could benefit from the higher level of customization that Custom LVC may provide. Custom LVC is necessary for some and desirable for many. Everyoneâ€™s eyes are different. Your pre-procedure consultation with your doctor will help determine the range of your probable outcome on your particular prescription, healing profile and expectations.</p>
