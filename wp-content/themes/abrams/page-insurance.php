      <p>As a comprehensive eye care practice composed of Ophthalmologists (MDs) and Optometrists (ODs), we are providers of both medical and vision insurance plans. Many patients now have both forms of insurance coverage. Few plans allow services to be split to both types of insurances. It is often confusing to all involved as to which insurance to submit. In general, if you are seeing us for a "medical" eye problem, we will file through your medical insurance carrier.</p><p>
      For Medicaid patients, please keep in mind that Indiana Medicaid will only cover one eye exam and glasses for adults (over 18) every 24 months. Medicaid recipients under the age of 18 are eligible every 12 months. You will be expected to pay for your exam at the time of service if you are not eligible for benefits.</p><p>Please be prepared to show us a copy of your insurance card and to pay your copay (if applicable) at the time of service. You may be asked to pay for services not usually covered by insurance such as a Contact Lens Evaluation or Refraction (measurement of glasses prescription). Based on Indiana law your contact lenses must be evaluated on yearly basis in order to refill your prescription. Both of these services are a necessary part of complete eye exams, even though your insurance may not cover them. You should know your insurance plans' policies including your co pays and deductibles.</p><p>We maintain signed agreements with a number of insurance carriers. Please advise us immediately if you are insured by a PPO or HMO plan. Many of these plans require that you obtain prior authorization before we are allowed to see you. Below are few insurances we currently participate with. Please feel free to contact us if you're insurance carrier is not on our list.</p>
