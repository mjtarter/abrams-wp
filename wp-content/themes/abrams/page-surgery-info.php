				<h3>What should I expect before, during, and after surgery?</h3>
				<p class="pb-10 nobottommargin"><span class="surgery-title">Before Surgery</span><br>If you decide to go ahead with LASIK surgery, you will need an initial or baseline evaluation by your eye doctor to determine if you are a good candidate. This is what you need to know to prepare for the exam and what you should expect:</p>
				<p>If you wear contact lenses, you should stop wearing them before your baseline evaluation and switch to wearing your glasses full-time. Contact lenses change the shape of your cornea for up to several weeks after you have stopped using them depending on the type of contact lenses you wear. Not leaving your contact lenses out long enough to allow your cornea to assume its natural shape before surgery can have negative consequences. These consequences include inaccurate measurements and a poor surgical plan, resulting in poor vision after surgery. These measurements, which determine how much corneal tissue to remove, may need to be repeated at least a week after your initial evaluation and before surgery to make sure they have not changed, especially if you wear RGP or hard lenses.</p>
				<p class="nobottommargin">If you wear:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> soft contact lenses, you should stop wearing them for 2 weeks before your initial evaluation</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> toric soft lenses or rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, you should stop wearing them for at least 3 weeks before your initial evaluation</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> hard lenses, you should stop wearing them for at least 4 weeks before your initial evaluation</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="nobottommargin">You should tell your doctor:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> about your past and present medical and eye conditions</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> about all the medications you are taking, including over-the-counter medications and - - any medications you may be allergic to</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="nobottommargin">Your doctor will perform a thorough eye exam and discuss:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> whether you are a good candidate</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> what the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery are</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> what you should expect before, during, and after surgery</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> what your responsibilities will be before, during, and after surgery</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="nobottommargin">The day before surgery, you should stop using:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> creams</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> lotions</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> makeup</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> perfumes</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These products as well as debris along the eyelashes may increase the risk of infection during and after surgery. Your doctor may ask you to scrub your eyelashes for a period of time before surgery to get rid of residues and debris along the lashes.</p>
				<p>Also before surgery, arrange for transportation to and from your surgery and your first follow-up visit. On the day of surgery, your doctor may give you some medicine to make you relax. Because this medicine impairs your ability to drive and because your vision may be blurry, even if you drive make sure someone can bring you home after surgery.</p>
				<p><span class="surgery-title">During Surgery</span><br>The surgery should take less than 30 minutes. You will lie on your back in a reclining chair in an exam room containing the laser system. The laser system includes a large machine with a microscope attached to it and a computer screen.</p>
				<p>A numbing drop will be placed in your eye, the area around your eye will be cleaned, and an instrument called a lid speculum will be used to hold your eyelids open. A ring will be placed on your eye and pressure applied to create suction to the cornea. Your vision will dim while the suction ring is on and you may feel pressure and experience some discomfort during this part of the procedure. A laser will be used to create the flap.</p>
				<p>The suction ring is removed. You will be able to see, but you will experience fluctuating degrees of blurred vision during the rest of the procedure. The doctor will then lift the flap and fold it back on its hinge, and dry the exposed tissue.</p>
				<p>The laser will be positioned over your eye and you will be asked to stare at a light. This is not the laser used to remove tissue from the cornea. This light is to help you keep your eye fixed on one spot once the laser is turned on.</p>
				<p>When your eye is in the correct position, your doctor will start the laser. At this point in the surgery, you may become aware of new sounds and smells. The pulse of the laser makes a ticking sound. As the laser removes corneal tissue, some people have reported a smell similar to burning hair. A computer controls the amount of laser delivered to your eye. Before the start of surgery, your doctor will have programmed the computer to vaporize a particular amount of tissue based on the measurements taken at your initial evaluation. After the pulses of laser energy vaporize the corneal tissue, the flap is put back into position.</p>
				<p>A shield will be placed over your eye at the end of the procedure as protection, since no stitches are used to hold the flap in place. When you sleep, it is important for you to wear this shield to prevent you from rubbing your eye and putting pressure on your eye for the first week after surgery.</p>
				<p><span class="surgery-title">After Surgery</span><br>Immediately after the procedure, your eye may burn, itch, or feel like there is something in it. You may experience some discomfort, or in some cases, mild pain and your doctor may suggest you take a mild pain reliever. Both your eyes may tear or water. Your vision will probably be hazy or blurry. You will instinctively want to rub your eye, but don't! Rubbing your eye could dislodge the flap, requiring further treatment. In addition, you may experience sensitivity to light, glare, starbursts or haloes around lights, or the whites of your eye may look red or bloodshot. These symptoms should improve considerably within the first few days after surgery. You should plan on taking a few days off from work until these symptoms subside. You should contact your doctor immediately and not wait for your scheduled visit, if you experience severe pain, or if your vision or other symptoms get worse instead of better.</p>
				<p>You will see your doctor within the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery and at regular intervals after that for at least the first six months. At the first postoperative visit, your doctor will remove the eye shield, test your vision, and examine your eye. Your doctor may give you one or more types of eye drops to take at home to help prevent infection and/or inflammation. You may also be advised to use artificial tears to help lubricate the eye. Do not resume wearing a contact lens in the operated eye, even if your vision is blurry.</p>
				<p>You should wait one to two weeks following surgery before beginning any non-contact sports, depending on the amount of activity required, how you feel, and your doctor's instructions. For contact sports, eye protection is needed for the first 4-6 weeks after surgery.</p>
				<p>To help prevent infection, you may need to wait for up to two weeks after surgery or until your doctor advises you otherwise before using lotions, creams, or make-up around the eye. Your doctor may advise you to continue scrubbing your eyelashes for a period of time after surgery. You should also avoid swimming and using hot tubs or whirlpools for 1-2 months.</p>
				<p>Strenuous contact sports such as boxing, football, karate, etc. should not be attempted for at least four weeks after surgery. It is important to protect your eyes from anything that might get in them and from being hit or bumped.</p>
				<p>During the first few months after surgery, your vision may fluctuate.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> It may take up to three to six months for your vision to stabilize after surgery.</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> Glare, haloes, difficulty driving at night, and other visual symptoms may also persist during this stabilization period. If further correction or enhancement is necessary, you should wait until your eye measurements are consistent for two consecutive visits at least 3 months apart before re-operation.</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> It is important to realize that although distance vision may improve after re-operation, it is unlikely that other visual symptoms such as glare or haloes will improve.</li>
					<li><i class="icon-line-arrow-right"></i> It is also important to note that no laser company has presented enough evidence for the FDA to make conclusions about the safety or effectiveness of enhancement surgery.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Contact your eye doctor immediately if you develop any new, unusual or worsening symptoms at any point after surgery. Such symptoms could signal a problem that, if not treated early enough, may lead to a loss of vision.</p>
